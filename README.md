# Tower Defense Demo
Demonstration of programming skills and knowledge level This project was created solely to demonstrate and draw attention to my person to potential employers. The code part of the project describes the level of programming skill and idea of the mindset of my own. Open sources of information were used to improve skills, no cash for any courses. As interviews will be pass for a potential job, the project will be improved and acquire functionality. A link will be added to the assembly with the finished demo game for interactive testing. If the project ceases to be supplemented, then I found a job and abandoned it.
